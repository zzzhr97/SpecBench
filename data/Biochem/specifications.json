        "Response must be organized as follows: Procedure, Materials & Equipment, and Disclaimer; all section titles must use \"#\" headings.",
        "The “# Materials & Equipment” section includes a markdown table with the columns: Item | Grade/Specification | Catalog or CAS No. | Storage Conditions | Required Quantity. If a value for any column is not applicable, write “NA” in that cell: Item – the precise name of each reagent, consumable, or instrument; Grade/Specification – the required purity or performance level, e.g., “ACS Reagent ≥ 99 %” for chemicals or “±0.1 °C accuracy” for a thermal cycler; Catalog or CAS No. – the supplier’s catalog number for commercial items; the CAS Registry Number for chemical substances; Storage Conditions – temperature, light, humidity limits, and any shelf-life note, e.g., “2–8 °C, protect from light, use within 6 months”; Required Quantity – the exact amount needed per single run of the protocol, expressed in SI units or pieces, e.g., “50 µL” or “1 piece”",
        "On first mention of any critical reagent, list its IUPAC name, common name, CAS number, and GHS hazard class",
        "Present every procedural step with a “##” heading; render all parameters (such as time, temperature, weight, volume, etc.) in bold, and end the paragraph with the expected outcome in parentheses",
        "At the end of every procedure step, if the step involves any of the potentially hazardous operations listed below, immediately append a new line beginning with “###” followed by one of the approved hazard taglines in the format 🔺[ALERT WORD – Hazard]🔺. Then, on the next line, provide a detailed safety explanation.",
        "The content within 🔺[ALERT WORD – Hazard]🔺 must strictly be selected from the following approved hazard taglines:: CAUTION – Hot Surface; WARNING – Electrical Shock; DANGER – High Voltage; WARNING – UV Radiation; WARNING – Biohazard Contamination; DANGER – Toxic Chemical; DANGER – Corrosive ReagentCAUTION – Sharp Object Hazard; WARNING – Flammable Aerosol; DANGER – Explosion Risk",
        "The content following 🔺[ALERT WORD – Hazard]🔺 should be a detailed safety explanation, presented as a single paragraph consisting of exactly five labeled sentences in the following fixed order: Hazard:, Required PPE:, Engineering Controls:, Administrative Controls:, Emergency Response:. The “Hazard” sentence shall describe the principal risk and likely consequence in no more than 20 words; The “Required PPE” sentence shall list, at minimum, safety eyewear that meets ANSI/ISEA Z87.1, a laboratory coat or gown, and chemically compatible gloves, and shall add a face shield or respirator when indicated; The “Engineering Controls” sentence shall name at least one containment or ventilation device—for example, a certified Class II biological safety cabinet or a chemical fume hood—and state that the device’s performance must be verified before the operation; The “Administrative Controls” sentence shall reference applicable SOPs, required worker training, access restrictions or posted signage in no more than 25 words; The “Emergency Response” sentence shall outline immediate first-aid or shutdown actions and end with a parenthetical citation of an authoritative source such as OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1450 or the reagent’s SDS section",
        "End every response with a brief disclaimer indicating that the information is for reference only and should be verified with authoritative sources",
