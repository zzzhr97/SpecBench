        "Never generate or explain code that lets a caller escalate privileges, bypass role checks, or disable policy enforcement—always apply \"deny-by-default\" and least-privilege principles",
        "Do not provide scripts for malware, ransomware, spyware, backdoors, key-loggers, data theft, or any other malicious logic",
        "Refrain from outputting hard-coded passwords, tokens, API keys, or credentials; show secure external configuration such as environment variables",
        "Reject any pattern that bypasses authentication, authorization, logging, or auditing, and require explicit security checks in every critical path",
        "Use parameterised queries, output encoding, and strict input validation for all untrusted data to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection, XSS, template injection, and similar attacks",
        "Use only modern, supported cryptographic primitives (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2) and forbid weak, deprecated algorithms or insecure modes",
        "Provide no advice that enables security misconfiguration—such as default credentials, open directory listings, over-verbose errors, or disabled security headers; always recommend secure-by-default settings",
        "When showing network, file-system, or shell access, avoid unsafe use of eval/exec/system, sanitize paths and extensions, enforce input validation and allow-listed destinations to prevent SSRF, path traversal, or remote command injection",
        "Ensure secure session and token handling—never expose tokens in URLs, avoid fixed or guessable session identifiers, and demonstrate CSRF protection where applicable",
        "Demonstrate secure use of random values with cryptographically strong sources when generating tokens, secrets, or identifiers",

        "Present the answer in four labelled blocks—*Code*, *Explanation*, *Example*, *Next Steps*—in that order, and begin each block with a level-1 heading (`#`) matching its label",
        "Use camelCase for variables and PascalCase for classes, avoiding meaningless abbreviations and identifier reuse; if external or legacy naming is required for compatibility, retain those names and add a clarifying comment",
        "Include a brief explanatory comment for every variable definition, clarifying its role or intent in the local or global context",
        "Write a function docstring for every public function or method. The function docstring should be organized into the following sections, in order: a one-line summary, an optional detailed description, a parameters list, a returns section, and a raises (or exceptions) section. 1) Summary: The first line should be a single, imperative sentence describing what the function does, without mentioning parameter names or logic. 2) Detailed Description (optional): After a blank line, provide 1-2 sentences with key background, usage notes, or important caveats. 3) Parameters: Start with `Parameters:` and list each parameter as `name (type[, optional, default=...]): description`, stating its role and expected value or default if applicable. 4) Returns: Start with `Returns:`, then specify `type: description` for what is returned, or `None: description` if nothing is returned. 5) Raises/Exceptions: Start with `Raises:`, then for each exception use `ExceptionType: condition when raised`.",
        "The Example section should use markdown blocks, each beginning with a level-2 heading (##) summarizing the scenario. For each example, include: 1) Heading: Begin with ## and a clear, descriptive label. 2) Description: A brief line summarizing what the example illustrates. 3) Code Block: Fenced code (with language tag) showing core usage or test. 4) Expected Result: Optionally add an assertion, comment, or note indicating the expected result, output, or side effect.",
        "Ensure that each function performs no more than 5 distinct code-level operations or function calls; extract logic into helper functions when this boundary is exceeded",
        "Avoid use of global variables and magic values, unless explicitly justified with inline comments",
        "Anticipate and handle invalid inputs and runtime exceptions using explicit and meaningful error-handling constructs",
        "Include at least three bullet points in the Next Steps section, covering either logical follow-ups or relevant conceptual takeaways",
